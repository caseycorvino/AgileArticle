## About the Article:

I thought that this article was interesting since it specifically analyzed the leaders in Agile organizations. The argument is that most leaders in these organizations are themselves not agile but rather enforce an agile environment to their subordinates. The article claims a lot of 'Agile' organizations have a very centralized chain of command. A truly Agile organization is very decentralized. In conclusion, it calls for the leaders of these organizations to be agile themselves.
